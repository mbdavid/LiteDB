## New Features
- Add support to NETStandard 2.0 (with support to `Shared` mode)
- New document `Expression` parser/executor - see [Expression Wiki](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB/wiki/Expressions)
- Support index creation with expressions
```C#
col.EnsureIndex(x => x.Name, "LOWER($.Name)");
col.EnsureIndex("GrandTotal", "SUM($.Items[*].Qtd * $.Items[*].Price)");
```
- Query with `Include` it´s supported in Engine level with ANY nested includes
```C#
col.Include(x => x.Users)
   .Include(x => x.Users[0].Address)
   .Include(x => x.Users[0].Address.City)
   .Find(...)
```
- Support complex Linq queries using `LinqQuery` compiler (works as linq to object)
  - `col.Find(x => x.Name == "John" && x.Items.Length.ToString().EndsWith == "0")`
- Better execution plan (with debug info) in multi query statements
- No more external journal file - use same datafile to store temporary data
- Fixed concurrency problems (keeps thread/process safe)
- Convert `Query.And` to `Query.Between` when possible
- Add support to `Query.Between` open/close interval
- **Same datafile from LiteDB `v3` (no upgrade needed)**

## Shell
- New UPDATE/SELECT statements in shell
- Shell commands parser/executor are back into LiteDB.dll
- Better shell error messages in parser with position in error
- Print query execution plan in debug
`(Seek([Age] > 10) and Filter([Name] startsWith "John"))`
(preparing to new visual LiteDB database management tool)

## Breaking changes
- Remove transactions
- Remove auto-id register function for custom type
- Remove index definitions on mapper (fluent/attribute)
- Remove auto create index on query execution. If the index is not found do full scan search (use `EnsureIndex` on initialize database)
